## 3D-printing
For our purposes we decided to use 3D print for building up housings. This is flexible and cost efficient. For more reliability against weather and mechanical stress it would be better to use housings milled from the solid material. There are good offers for 3-axis CNC mills - maybe we will test this later on. (It seems we seriously need to talk to Santa regarding this. :-D )
### Dealing with ASA-filament
The outdoor usage of Heidi-Tracker requires a weather proofed housing material. We decided for ASA-filament from PolyMaker (for no special reasons). If you not own a industrial like 3D-printer, printing ASA-filament is not quite simple. The temperature for the material nozzle and the build plate (bed) needs to be adjusted depending on the geometry of the part you intend to print. (As far as we discovered due to many tries.)
### Warping
[(warping - see here)](https://support.ultimaker.com/hc/article_attachments/360009279100/How_to_fix_warping_Warping_model.jpg)<br />
Warping is the main issue while printing ASA filament.
